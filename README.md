# ATS-Article-Measure-Correlation
This project includes a set of Python scripts designed for processing and analyzing text data. It leverages various natural language processing techniques, including BERT embeddings and TF-IDF vectorization, to compute correlations between different text documents.
## Features
- Text encoding using BERT and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Calculation of cosine correlations between different text documents.
- Efficient data processing using Pandas and NumPy.
